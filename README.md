# smart-url

Most URL shorteners simply store a long URL and return a short code that always redirects to the same destination. SmartURL takes it a step further by allowing the creator to specify conditional redirection rules. For example, a marketer might want:

Mobile users (detected via the User-Agent) to be sent to a mobile-optimized page.
Visitors from a specific region (detected via their IP/geolocation) to be sent to a localized landing page.

Everyone else to be redirected to a default URL.
This extra “smart” redirection feature is something you don’t typically see in off-the-shelf URL shorteners.
